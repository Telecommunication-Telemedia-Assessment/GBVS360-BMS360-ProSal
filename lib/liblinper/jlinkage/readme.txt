------------- Brief Package Description -------------------
This archive contains the precompiled library/mex files for win32/64 as well as the Visual Studio 2008 project files.
The code is splitted in 3 sub-projects:
JLinkageLib - Use this one if you want to embed JLinkage inside your c/c++ project.
The code is structured in two main classed: Random Sampler (RandomSampler.h/cpp) class and a JLinkage class(JLinkage.h/cpp).
The code should be self-understandable.
RandomSamplerMex/ClusterizeMex - interfaces for mex/matlab. If you need to use jlinkage inside matlab you need to call these mex files from matlab. 
For a jump start have a look at the /bin/runme.m file.
