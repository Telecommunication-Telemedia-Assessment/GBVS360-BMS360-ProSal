# GBVS360, BMS360, ProSal: Extending existing saliency prediction models from 2D to omnidirectional images 

In this project, it is studied how existing visual saliency models designed for 2D images can be extended and applied to Omnidirectional images in the equirectangular format. Three different frameworks, BMS360, GBVS360 and Projected Saliency (ProSal) were designed to address this task. In the particular case of BMS360 and GBVS360, the 2D models Boolean Map Saliency (BMS) and Graph-Based Visual Saliency (GBVS) were rigorously extended to integrate the specific properties of equirectangular images to model visual attention in omnidirectional images watched using Head Mounted Displays (HMDs). With the proposed extensions, the saliency prediction performance in comparison to their original design could significantly be improved. 


# Context 

This project was initially created to address the ICME2017 Grand Challenge on Visual attention for 360 images. 

The goals of this grand challenges were as follows: Understanding how users watch a 360Â° image and analyzing how they scan through the content with a combination of head and eye movement, is necessary to develop appropriate rendering devices and also create good VR/AR content for consumers. Good visual attention modeling is a key factor in that perspective that helps enhance the overall Quality of Experience (QoE). Although a huge number of algorithms have been developed in recent years to gauge visual attention in flat-2D images and videos and also a benchmarking platform (saliency.mit.edu) where users can submit and assess their results, attention studies in 360o scenarios are absent. The goal of this challenge is to therefore two-fold:

   - to produce a dataset to ensure easy and precise reproducibility of results for future saliency / scan-path computational models in line with the principles of Reproducible and Sustainable research from IEEE.

   - to set a first baseline for the taxonomy of several types of visual attention models (saliency models, importance models, saccadic models) and the correct methodology and ground-truth data to test each of them.


In the first stage, we present a dataset of sixty 360o images along with the associated head and eye-tracking data. An additional 20 images will be provided without any tracking data. As all images are covered under the Creative Commons copyright, you are free to reuse and redistribute the content for research purposes along with relevant citations and links to our hosting website and paper which provides appropriate credits to the photographers. We additionally provide 3 software: VR content playback module, a benchmarking tool and saliency/ scan-path generator for use by the participants.



# Binaries

In the release section of GitHub, different set of binaries can be found. The version 1.0 correspond to the models submitted to the ICME2017 Grand Challenge. These models were ranked as first at addressing Head motion-based saliency maps out of 13 submissions. And was ranked and was ranked 6th (5.75) out of 16 submissions when Head/Eye motion-based saliency maps are addressed. 

The release with a version higher than 1.0 were the result of work performed after the end of the competition. Version 2.0 includes the BMS360 model.



# Build from source

To compile the project, only two dependencies are required: 

   - boost (>= 1.63)

   - OpenCV (>= 3.0)


## UNIX system

run the script "build.sh".  

## Windows: 

A visual studio solution file is provided (tested using the 2015 Community edition). A complete set of all depending libraries can be found at the following URL: https://1drv.ms/u/s!AqL868MBKJ4Gh-guxlbtLEQ4h6VqXw 
Unzip the folder Library next to the clone of the repository. Then, open the visual studio solution file, and you can compile the project (The path to the external library folder is set relatively to the root folder).
