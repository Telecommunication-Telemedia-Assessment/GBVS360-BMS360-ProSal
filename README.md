# Salient360 -- ICME2017 Grand Challenge on Visual attention for 360 images.

Understanding how users watch a 360Â° image and analyzing how they scan through the content with a combination of head and eye movement, is necessary to develop appropriate rendering devices and also create good VR/AR content for consumers. Good visual attention modeling is a key factor in that perspective that helps enhance the overall Quality of Experience (QoE). Although a huge number of algorithms have been developed in recent years to gauge visual attention in flat-2D images and videos and also a benchmarking platform (saliency.mit.edu) where users can submit and assess their results, attention studies in 360o scenarios are absent. The goal of this challenge is to therefore two-fold:

   - to produce a dataset to ensure easy and precise reproducibility of results for future saliency / scan-path computational models in line with the principles of Reproducible and Sustainable research from IEEE.

   - to set a first baseline for the taxonomy of several types of visual attention models (saliency models, importance models, saccadic models) and the correct methodology and ground-truth data to test each of them.
What we provide

In the first stage, we present a dataset of sixty 360o images along with the associated head and eye-tracking data. An additional 20 images will be provided without any tracking data. As all images are covered under the Creative Commons copyright, you are free to reuse and redistribute the content for research purposes along with relevant citations and links to our hosting website and paper which provides appropriate credits to the photographers. We additionally provide 3 software: VR content playback module, a benchmarking tool and saliency/ scan-path generator for use by the participants.

# What is expected from the participants

Proponent/participants are expected to develop computational models to detect the visually salient regions for the given 360o images in a task independent free-viewing condition encompassing possible user head and eye motion.

The participants are free to use the 60 image+tracking dataset for training and tune their algorithms as necessary and may also compute the benchmark scores as a reference for themselves. When the participants have decided to go ahead with the algorithm submission, they need to submit the binaries to the organizers so that we may evaluate the performance of their algorithms on the 20 image dataset (only whose images have been publically available to the participants without the tracking data). An automated e-mail confirms the status of your submission. Winners and top-performing algorithms will be contacted separately by the organizers to encourage them for a demo during the actual ICME conference.
